# Explainable-AI-with-transformer-learning-for-crop-disease-assessment-using-thermal-imaging
"In my project, I applied EfficientNetB0 as the core deep learning model for classifying thermal images of diseased and healthy crop leaves.
EfficientNetB0 was chosen because of its balanced accuracy and computational efficiencyâ€”it scales depth, width, and resolution uniformly using compound scaling, which allowed me to achieve high accuracy without increasing the model size drastically. 
The model was trained on thermal images captured using an IR sensor, making it a non-invasive and efficient approach to early disease detection.
We also integrated XAI techniques like LIME and SHAP to interpret model predictions, improving transparency and trust in real-time decision-making. 
This combination of EfficientNetB0 and explainable AI has shown nearly 99% accuracy and outperformed existing CNN-based approaches, making it highly suitable for resource-constrained agricultural monitoring systems."
